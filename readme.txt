Affiliates plugin integration for Contact Form 7. Collect form data & track submissions. Lead tracking, sales, support ...

== Description ==

This plugin integrates [Affiliates](http://www.itthinx.com/plugins/affiliates/), [Affiliates Pro](http://www.itthinx.com/plugins/affiliates-pro/) and [Affiliates Enterprise](http://www.itthinx.com/plugins/affiliates-enterprise/) with [Contact Form 7](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/contact-form-7).


**Data storage & referrals**

This integration stores data from submitted forms and tracks form submissions to the referring affiliate.

Submissions through one or more forms handled by Contact Form 7 can generate referrals. This integration can generate referrals for all forms, restrict it to selected forms or exclude certain forms.


**Form data**

All submitted form data is stored and can be viewed on the administrative back end along with each referral. All or parts of submitted form data can be provided in notification emails to affiliates. Form data can also be displayed on the front through referral stats. This allows to display selected pieces of information for example to affiliates or sales team members.
Flexible referral amounts and currencies

Contact Form 7 forms can generate referrals with fixed amounts, rate-based amounts or based on custom methods. Forms can provide fixed referral amount or base amounts for rate calculations. Multi-currency systems are supported by Affiliates Pro and forms can provide different currencies in each submission.


**Notifications**

Notifications require [Affiliates Pro](http://www.itthinx.com/plugins/affiliates-pro/) or [Affiliates Enterprise](http://www.itthinx.com/plugins/affiliates-enterprise/).

Upon each form submission, this integration can send notification emails to the site admin as well as to the referring affiliate. Affiliate notification emails for affiliates are customizable and can include information provided in submitted forms.


**Application Suggestions**


*Lead tracking*

Sales leads who submit a form managed through Affiliates Pro for Contact Form 7 can be tracked down to the referring affiliate, so that commissions for offline or online sales can be credited to the affiliate. If desired, commissions that are determined upon form submission will appear as referral amounts along with each referral.
